### Chose a DFT dataset

Choose a DFT dataset. Currently, this code accepts either two `xyz` files, one for training and one for testing, or a single `xyz` file, which is automatically split into training and testing. Example datasets can be downloaded from the following urls.
- a-HfO2 dataset: "Machine-learned interatomic potentials by active learning: amorphous and liquid hafnium dioxide".
