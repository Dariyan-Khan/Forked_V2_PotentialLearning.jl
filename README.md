## [WIP] PotentialLearning.jl: an open source library for the active learning and fast calculation of interatomic potentials in atomistic simulations of materials.

Developed as part of [CESMIX](https://cesmix.mit.edu).

This package is currently being refactored. See [Atomistic Composable Workflows](https://github.com/cesmix-mit/AtomisticComposableWorkflows) for current Julia case studies.
